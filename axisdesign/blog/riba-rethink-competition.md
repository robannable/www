## Introduction

In June 2020, Axis Design's entry to RIBA's Rethink: 2025 competition developed the concept of the Street Support Hub, an infrastructure facility linking private homes and households with local government services, green energy, and community support. The brief asked participants to consider life in 2025 and how the pandemic will have modified the way humans interact with space and one another.

## Project Overview

**Street Support Hub 2020**

The Street Support Hub is envisioned as a relatively simple addition to local neighbourhoods, providing facilities to downscale key activities and interactions, and relocate them closer to the home. This allows people to reduce their movement and, with it, routes for community transmission while maintaining essential services and social connections.

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by the rapid spread of mutual aid networks, growing support for green technologies, and a re-evaluation of the house as a technology of preparedness, the Support Hub starts from the assumption that community care is a better relationship to hold to than containment and boundary-protection.

## Green Energy Source

Each Street Support Hub provides a green energy source and facilities for decentralised energy storage, enabling the installation to operate as a community-scale power station. Though the chosen energy source depends on location and available assets, the infrastructure is compatible with solar battery storage, heat pumps, district heat networks, and CHP fuel cells. By using smart metering and aggregating supply and demand, the connected community can use stored energy more efficiently.

## Common Room

The Support Hub creates common rooms providing a new 'third place' outside the home. The common room is a multifunctional space suited for use as a base for voluntary organisations and mutual aid networks, a private meeting room for residents seeking support from local authority and service providers, teaching space for groups of children during lockdown, temporary workspace for those with limited room in their homes, and social space designed to support distancing with adequate ventilation.

## Charging Station

The Street Support Hub infrastructure is completed by connecting green energy and common room facilities to a zero-carbon transport network. Individual Hubs bolster traffic calming measures and provide car, bicycle, and scooter charging points for frontline workers, residents, and volunteers. Secure cabinets and lockers offer access to 24-hour deliveries of food, medicine, and other goods.

## Future Vision

The proposal represents a vision for resilient community infrastructure that responds to both immediate pandemic challenges and longer-term needs for sustainable, locally-managed services and energy systems.
