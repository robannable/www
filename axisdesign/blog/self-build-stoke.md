## Introduction

Axis Design was successful in a competitive tender for Stoke-on-Trent City Council's first Custom Home Building project. The former Penkhull Farm site on Newcastle Lane was chosen by Stoke City Council for an initial site appraisal and outline planning application. The outline application proposals provide guidance to future investors regarding the key principles of the site and acknowledge the need to create low energy homes.

## Project Overview

**Penkhull Farm, Newcastle Lane 2012-2013**

Recent work around the Affordable Passivhaus project led to the development of house type models that deliver the highest level of energy performance at low cost. This research was incorporated into the Custom Home Building project, demonstrating how Passivhaus principles could be made accessible to self-builders.

## Technology Integration

The Custom Home Building project was supported through the use of web-based project management systems to improve liaison with all stakeholders. Building Information Modelling (BIM) was included as part of the service, reflecting the practice's commitment to innovative design and construction processes.

## Policy Context

The Government's Housing Strategy paper published in November 2011 proposed financial support for self-build developments, referred to as 'Custom Home Building'. Through this policy, councils were asked to assess the demand for custom-build in their area and take positive steps to facilitate it.

## Community Engagement

Stoke City Council's Mandate for Change set out a clear plan to make Stoke-on-Trent a great city to live in, with Custom Home Building proposed to assist in improving housing quality across the city. The project was used at the council's Housing Summit to publicise Custom Home Building to local residents and potential partners.

## Project Development

Initial proposals for the site were complete and presented to the public, discussing the future of the scheme. Example house types were created that self builders might consider, along with information about Passivhaus research and examples of materials and products that a self build project could benefit from.

## Recognition

The project won 'Best Custom Build Scheme' at the 2013 Build It awards, recognizing its innovative approach to supporting self-builders in creating high-quality, energy-efficient homes.
