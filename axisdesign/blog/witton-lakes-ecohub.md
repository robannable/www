## Introduction

Witton Lakes Community Association wished to create a new future for the Park Keeper's cottage by the reservoir, provided to them via an asset transfer from Birmingham City Council. Axis Design assisted from the beginning of the concept, collaborating in meetings and funding applications to raise money to realise their goal.

## Project Overview

**Witton Lakes 2020**

The project creates a new community hall extension to the existing building and envisages a base for hosting events and displays around the subject of fuel and energy-saving, landscape and ecology. The facility is designed to serve as both a community resource and an educational center promoting environmental awareness.

## Sustainable Construction

Sustainable construction and detailing are central to the design of the scheme. Collaboration with Price & Myers structural engineers created a glulam timber frame structure visible throughout the interior, demonstrating sustainable construction techniques while creating a warm, natural interior environment.

## Educational Mission

The Ecohub concept integrates community facility provision with environmental education, creating a building that embodies the principles it seeks to promote. The design approach emphasizes natural materials and passive environmental systems, providing a demonstration of sustainable building practices for community groups.

## Community Asset Transfer

The project represents a successful example of community asset transfer, where local organizations take ownership of public buildings and transform them to serve contemporary community needs while advancing environmental awareness and action.
