## Introduction

A Birmingham charity needed a new base on their waterside green space. Axis Design secured planning approval for a new community building on behalf of Birmingham Settlement to be built on their playing field site next to Edgbaston Reservoir.

## Project Overview

**Edgbaston Reservoir 2020**

The new building sites itself on the original footprint of the previous building to serve the field, with a minor increase in size to accommodate space for group events and toilet facilities. The building aims to create a new beacon set against the green landscape of the site to make it visible to passers-by from the reservoir path and uses an unusual roof form and colour palette to announce its presence.

## Sustainable Materials

The project collaborates with Webb Yates engineers on the detailing and quality of low-carbon, natural materials including Porotherm clay blocks, cellulose insulation and timber. The material selection demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility while creating a building that will serve the community for decades to come.

## Design Philosophy

The design approach balances the need for a practical community facility with architectural quality that enhances the waterside setting. The building's form and materials are carefully considered to complement the natural landscape while providing the functionality required by Birmingham Settlement's community programs.
