## Introduction

One of Axis Design's latest projects received planning approval by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. The design responds to tight site constraints and a brief calling for an exemplar, environmentally friendly scheme. Carefully orientated to make the most of the south-east and south-west sun, the saw-tooth layout and innovative roof plan create an animated, interesting street scene.

## Project Overview

**Stourbridge 2007-2008**

This project was developed in collaboration with Kier Homes and Black Country Housing Association. The development achieved Ecohomes 'excellent' rating, demonstrating how high environmental standards could be integrated into contemporary housing design while creating distinctive architectural character.

## Design Approach

The design uses a saw-tooth arrangement where each property has a slightly different relationship with the street, depending on the paving and door position. This approach creates visual variety while optimizing solar orientation and responding to the site's environmental opportunities.

## Sustainable Technology Integration

Originally including wind turbines in the initial design proposals, these were subsequently removed due to concern about cost and their likely poor performance in an urban area. This decision demonstrated the importance of selecting appropriate sustainable technologies for urban contexts.

## Project Success

The scheme represents a successful integration of environmental performance with architectural quality, showing how sustainable design principles can enhance rather than constrain creative expression. The project's success led to its submission for a Building For Life award, aiming for gold standard recognition.
