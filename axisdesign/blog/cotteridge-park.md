## Introduction

Friends of Cotteridge Park needed a new building to help support their extensive work with the local community. The facility provides a meeting space and shelter throughout the year and is designed to be a robust, permanent solution yet have minimal impact on the landscape.

## Project Overview

**Cotteridge Park 2020**

Designed in collaboration with Wikihouse, the innovative plywood structure is created from CNC routed bespoke pieces, forming box panels and beams that are fully insulated and assembled on site. The final structure is finished in a plain metal cladding to receive a community art mural and kept warm and efficient with triple glazing.

## Environmental Strategy

A sedum roof helps the building respond to the changing seasons and reduce overheating. The environmental strategy integrates passive design principles with innovative construction technology to create a building that demonstrates sustainable community architecture.

## Wikihouse Collaboration

The Wikihouse collaboration represents an exploration of open-source construction methodologies, where digital fabrication techniques enable precise, efficient assembly while supporting local community involvement in the building process. This approach aligns with the client's community-focused mission and demonstrates how innovative construction techniques can serve grassroots organizations.

## Community Impact

The building's design minimizes its environmental footprint while maximizing its community impact, providing a flexible space that can adapt to various community activities throughout the year.
