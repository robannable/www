## Introduction

Axis Design is supporting Witton Lakes Community Association with concept proposals for the refurbishment and re-use of a public baths building, exploring ideas around co-working and community services through project team and stakeholder discussions, precedent study visits, drawings and visualisations.

## Project Overview

**Witton Lakes Community Association 2020**

The project investigates how historic community buildings can be adapted for contemporary uses, specifically examining the potential for co-working spaces to serve local communities while preserving the architectural heritage of municipal buildings.

## Planning and Funding

Collaboration with a cost consultant and considering possible phasing and fundraising is a critical part of the role for the client. The work will form the backbone of future funding applications to revitalise the street and building, demonstrating how careful planning and design can unlock the potential of underused community assets.

## Stakeholder Engagement

The concept development process includes extensive stakeholder engagement to understand community needs and aspirations, ensuring that any future development serves the local population while creating economically viable co-working opportunities.

## Future Vision

The project represents an exploration of how changing work patterns and community needs can be accommodated within existing building stock, contributing to both economic regeneration and heritage preservation.
