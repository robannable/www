## Introduction

Axis Design won a competitive bid to refurbish 6 terrace properties in Newcastle-Under-Lyme as part of a project to substantially increase the environmental performance of existing Victorian housing stock. The goal was to help take part in the progress of the national debate about the importance of improving the quality of the country's existing housing stock.

## Project Overview

**Newcastle-Under-Lyme 2007-2009**

Working with Staffordshire Housing Association and Brown & Clowes for Renew North Staffordshire and Newcastle-Under-Lyme Borough Council, the design delivered robust, replicable solutions to both the improvement of the fabric, the quality of the living space and the thermal performance. Continuing explorations into solar passive architecture, the design features 2 storey spaces proposed as replacements to the standard usually outrigger found on Victorian terrace housing.

## Post-Occupancy Monitoring

One of the most interesting aspects of the project was the post-occupancy monitoring work completed in collaboration with Hockerton Housing Projects. The comprehensive monitoring programme provided valuable data about the actual results of design techniques and products, as well as an understanding of what it's like to live in a property with substantially improved environmental performance.

## Recognition and Awards

The first two properties were officially opened with the help of renowned ecologist David Bellamy. The project was highly commended at the Staffordshire Construction Awards and won Building magazine's '99% Campaign Award for Refurbishment', while also reaching the finals of both CIH Housing Awards and Inside Housing magazine's Sustainability Awards.

## Digital Documentation

Progress was documented through a dedicated website using blogging techniques including written diary, phone camera blog, flickr images and social bookmarking links. The project demonstrated innovative ways to share technical information about sustainability approaches through interactive online design guides powered by collaborative web technologies.
